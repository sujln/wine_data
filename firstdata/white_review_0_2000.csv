The bubbly delivers evident aromas of brioche, toast, honey, chalk, lemon, cheese, and barely ripe apricot, which you also discover once in the mouth.

Much darker in the bottle than it is in the glass - subtle nose of strawberry, through to the palate with the right amount of acidity and finesse to make it a super enjoyable summer ros√© (serious, but not too serious).', ""Always interesting to try the 'minor' wines from top producers. This PYCM Ros√© de Pinot Noir is very pale, with a colour more orange than pink. The minerals define it, stone on the nose, plus salt on the palate. Leafy aroma, some cherry and raspberry, not a lot of fruit. Taste includes lemon and grapefruit, with a distinct bitterness that I would not immediately associate with Pinot Noir. Creamy, with loads of acidity. I like it; the class and balance I would expect from a quality label.

Awesome stuff', 'Nice sweet wine. Wow. ', 'Passion fruit aroma with slight acidity and great sweet taste. Good dessert wine.', 'Sweet fruit festival. This is like liquid Ambien, really takes the edge off.', 'A delicious dessert wine that dances on the palate. In a balanced presentation of a rich honey sweetness that is not overdone.

The clear aroma of Black currant leaves is what really reveals the the disguised sheep. Still NZ best Sauvignon white. Ping me if you disagree.', ""This was something unusual and in a really good way so. Rich nose which has multilayered aromas, mandarin to mango, some exotic fruits and as maker mentions bees wax that might be the one interesting note on the nose.

Intensive forest fruits. Probably good with medium strong cheese.', 'A glass at Ramos Pinto, this was initially a little closed, particularly compared to the 1982 vintage alongside it. After some patient swirling prune and dried raspberry fruit emerges, with spice and tobacco. The palate is very smooth; sweet and chocolatey in the house style.

Attack is very sweet but let it hang out for bit. The tannins are gorgeous. Great finish. ', 'Excellent, tight fruit, really fresh.', 'Super concentrated red fruit, raisins, berry jam, vanilla, oak.
